nfy - not(ifications) for you
------------------

nfy is a seriously dumb and pointless little script for diplaying notifications.

Work in progress.


How it works
------------

In short, nfy opens a new connection to the X server, creates a window, displays
a message (string argument passed to nfy), waits until either Tab is pressed or
the window is clicked, then destroys the window and closes the connection.

This is an incredibly stupid solution for displaying a notification.

But it works.


Requirements
------------

In order to build nfy, you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------

nfy is installed into ~/bin by default. Unless changed, do not run make as root.

    $ make clean install


Usage
-----

nfy takes one optional string argument which constitutes the message displayed.

If no argument is passed, the notification will have you know so.

    $ nfy "This is a notification"
    $ nfy


Why on earth
------------

I thought it'd be fun to give it a shot.
