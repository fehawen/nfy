nfy - not(ifications) for you
------------------

nfy + nfyer is a seriously dumb and pointless little tool for diplaying notifications.


How it works
------------

In short, nfyer opens a new connection to the X server, creates a window,
displays a message (string argument passed to nfy, which invokes nfyer), waits
until either Tab is pressed if the window is focused, or if the window is clicked,
then destroys the window and closes the connection.

This is an incredibly stupid solution for displaying a notification.
Seriously, it's just daft.

But it works.


Requirements
------------

In order to build, you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------

nfy and nfyer are installed into ~/bin by default. Unless changed, do not run make as root.

    $ make clean install


Usage
-----

nfy takes one optional string argument which constitutes the message displayed.

If no argument is passed, the notification will have you know so.

    $ nfy "This is a notification"
    $ nfy


Notes
-----

Only console fonts are supported at the moment, meaning you will have to manually
edit the font used in nfyer.c, given that you know which console fonts you have
available.

You can use [xlf] to find how which fonts you have on your system that will work
with nfyer.

Why on earth
------------

I thought it'd be fun to give it a shot.
